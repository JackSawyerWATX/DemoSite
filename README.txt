This is the new begining to my portfolio website. Here I will be listing the updates and 
making notes for myself of things I have completed, as well as making plans for the next 
updates.

Things I am woking on today are:
	1. Adding functionality to the contact section to send messages to my email
	2. Adding an href to the email icon at the bottom of the page.

I would like to:
	1. Work with the Cardinal CSS framework at https://cardinalcss.com/
	2. Also work with Gatsby framework at https://www.gatsbyjs.com/
